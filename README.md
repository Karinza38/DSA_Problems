# # Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Codes & Notes

This repository contains the implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts that I have learned from **GeeksforGeeks (GFG) Self-Paced course** and **Striver's DSA resources**. It includes well-documented code implementations as well as comprehensive notes, making it a go-to place for DSA learning and interview preparation.

## 📚 **Contents**

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees & Binary Trees**
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **Hashing**
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
- **Mathematical Algorithms**


## 💻 **Code Structure**

Each DSA topic has its own folder with:
- **Code Implementations:** Efficient, clean, and well-structured solutions to common DSA problems.
- **Notes:** Key concepts, explanations, and important formulas.
  
## 📝 **Resources**

- **GFG Self-Paced DSA Course:** [Link to GFG](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/dsa-self-paced)
- **Striver's DSA Playlist & Resources:** [Link to Striver's Resources](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)

## 📈 **How to Use**

1. **Explore the Topics:** Navigate through the different folders for various DSA topics.
2. **Practice the Code:** Each code is optimized for understanding and interview preparation.
3. **Refer to the Notes:** Use the notes to brush up on concepts or clarify doubts.
